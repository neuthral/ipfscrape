## IPFScrape

run to scrape website and pin in your ipfs repository + output the links tino links.txt file
`./run.sh https://html-link >> links.txt`

![GIF of usage](preview.gif)

Takes a URL (webpage), downloads all the contents (css, images, scripts needed) for a page and dumps it into IPFS, providing you with a public link and a local link. Use for making quick copies of websites or permanent copies that you can send to friends.

Quick tool I wrote during the first Open Source Day at Typeform.

## Usage

* Clone repository
* Run `./run.sh $URL`
  * Example: `./run.sh https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System`
* Look at the bottom of the output, two links are provided. One `localhost` for you own, local pleasure. And one to the public gateway, `ipfs.io` that you can send to other people. Note: You'll need to be online for the public gateway to be able to download the site from you.
